Title: Build and Interpret Cron Strings with R
Version: 0.0.0.9002
Authors@R: 
    person(given = "Matt",
           family = "Dray",
           role = c("aut", "cre"),
           email = "mwdray@gmail.com")
Description: Provide R expressions as inputs and get a standard cron string in
    return. These strings are in a special format that's recognised by various
    systems that are designed to help you schedule computer tasks. It's easy to
    forget the required esoteric structure, hence the existence of web services
    like <https://crontab.guru/> and this package.
