Authors@R: 
    person(given = "Matt",

           email = "mwdray@gmail.com")
Description: Provide R objects as inputs and get a standard cron expression in
    return. These strings have a special format recgonised by Unix/Linux systems
    to help you schedule computer tasks. It's easy to forget the required
    structure, hence the existence of web services like <https://crontab.guru/>
    and this package.
