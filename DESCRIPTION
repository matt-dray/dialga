Title: Build and Interpret Cron Strings with R
Version: 0.0.0.9003
Authors@R: 
    person(given = "Matt",
           family = "Dray",
           role = c("aut", "cre"),
           email = "mwdray@gmail.com")
Description: Provide R integer vectors as inputs and get a standard cron string
    in return. Cron strings are in a special format that's recognised by cron
    software to help you schedule computer tasks. It's easy to forget the
    required esoteric structure, hence the existence of web services like
    <https://crontab.guru/> and this package. You can also supply a cron string
    and get an English interpretation in return.
